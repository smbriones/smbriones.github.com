# UX Design Apprenticeship at 8th Light
The submission for *part three* of my Design Apprenticeship Challenges.

## The Challenge as written by my Mentor

Your challenge will be to design and build a website that will serve as a 
"living" syllabus for the Design Apprenticeship at 8th Light. You are free 
to model the syllabus after your own apprenticeship experience. Be sure to 
include projects, readings, and structured experiences (your time working 
on client projects). 

Here are a few REQUIREMENTS:

* Use HTML5 and CSS3 (and optionally JS).

* You cannot use any frameworks (everything must be written by you, from scratch.)

* Your site must be responsive and accommodate a minimum of 3 breakpoints 
(Desktop [1024px x 768px], iPad, and iPhone). 

* Your site must work seamlessly in IE8+, and the latest versions of Safari, 
Firefox, Chrome and yes, Opera. It doesn't need to look the *exact* same 
in every browser, but it should not look broken in any of them.

Here are some things I will be looking for:

* Evidence of a modular scale and grid based design.
* Evidence of a personal design "style."
* Typographic excellence. 
* Clean, semantic and well written HTML and CSS. 
* Code style and naming convention(s). 
* CSS maintainability (think: SMACSS).
* File structure and organization. 
* Usability (â€¦consider testing). 

A successful submission will require you to consolidate everything you've learned 
during your apprenticeship. You'll need to demonstrate how good of a designer you 
really are.
