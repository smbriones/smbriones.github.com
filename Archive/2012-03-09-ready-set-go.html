  Today is also the day I start my challenges, which makes it a pretty 
  interesting day for me. I have so many different feelings at once. 
  I'm nervous, of course, a little nostalgic, and also really excited. 
  This next two weeks will probably rush by, as the past eight months 
  have, as I push my skills to the limit and put everything I have into 
  the assignment that I'm given.

  It has been an awesome eight months. Looking back to when I began, it's 
  amazing how much I've learnedâ€”and it's just the beginning. I'm so thankful 
  to Billy for accepting me as an apprentice and helping me become a better 
  designer. I can't wait to see what the future holds.
