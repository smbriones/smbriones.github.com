<p>
  This project is rather tricky, so it was great to be able to work with someone 
  that is an expert in knowing where to find everything and understands how 
  everything is structured.

  Alone, it would have taken me quite a while to get to a point where I felt 
  comfortable enough to start working, but with the developer there, working 
  with me, we started work immediately, not wasting any time. He tought me and 
  I learned, while we worked.

  I hope that I continue to have the opportunity to pair with developers in the 
  future. It's a fun and insightful way to work.
