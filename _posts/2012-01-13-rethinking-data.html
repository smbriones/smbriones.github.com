  This week has been Edward R. Tufte's <em>Envisioning Information</em>. 
  It is packed with many valuable insights. I am sure that if you have the great 
  pleasure of creating a table or two on occasion, you would benefit from reading 
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118"
  <em>Envisioning Information</em></a>.

<h3>Constructing Tables</h3>
<p>
  Tabular data is pretty universally important. We use and rely on 
  tables daily, but they are usually painful to design and to look at. If 
  we could learn how to display information in a simple, more 
  straightforward way, I think that we might grow to enjoy 
  creating tables that we and other people can appreciate.
</p>
<p>
  Using Tufte's guidance regarding tabular data, I'd like to try to redesign a 
  table, one that could use a little work. I encourage you to try it too. 
  Here's a table I found via Google image search.
</p>

<p>
  This table isn't all bad, it just could use a couple of tweaks to make 
  the information a little easier to digest. Some of the things I instantly 
  noticed are the center alignment of the first column, the left alignment 
  of the table headers, and the right alignment of the table data. Just evening 
  those out would go a long way in making improving the table's readability.
</p>
<h3>
  Here's what I might do:
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the borders.</li>
  <blockquote><em>
  "First try to do without rules altogether. They should be used only 
  when they are absolutely necessary. Vertical rules are needed only 
  when the space between columns is so narrow that mistakes will occur 
  ..." <cite>Jan Tschichold, Asymmetric Typography</cite>
  </em></blockquote>
  <li>Enlarge the title of the table.</li>
  <li>Left align the data.</li>
  <li>Simplify color.</li>
  <blockquote><em>
    "The often scant benefits derived from coloring data 
    indicates that even putting a good color in a good place is a 
    complex matter." <cite>Paul Klee, Notebooks: The Thinking Eye</cite>
  </em></blockquote>
  <li>Allow some breathing room.</li>
  <li>Given the probable audience, simplify wording and numbers.</li>
  <blockquote><em>"... our readers are alert and caring; they may be 
      busy, eager to get on with it, but they are not stupid." 
      <cite>Edward Tufte, Envisioning Information</cite>
  </em></blockquote>
</ol>

  Here's what I came up with. There may be more here that could be changed, there may 
  be a whole new way to present this data. I'd love to see how many 
  different solutions could be thought up for this one table.
</p>
<p>
  Tufte's <em>Envisioning Information</em> is definitely a book that I 
  will reference again and again.
