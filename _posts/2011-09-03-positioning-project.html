  The article was “<a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/37-css-absolute-and-fixed-positioning/">
  CSS absolute and fixed positioning</a>” on 
  <a href="http://www.dev.opera.com">Dev.Opera</a> by Tommy Olsson.

  While reading the article I took notes, did the exercises, and some sketching. While reading and taking notes, I thought that 
  maybe the best way to remember everything I had read and practice the things I had learned, was to create something that could be 
  used as a reference. So here's <a href="http://stephaniebriones.com/testing/positioning/">what I came up with</a>:

  This was a really fun assignment, (Thanks, 
  <a href-"http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/billy-whited">Billy</a>!) and I hope that the article will be as informative to you 
  as it was to me, and that you may be able to use my project as a reference.

  FYI, there is still work that needs to be done, mostly to the html, so please overlook that for now. ;)
