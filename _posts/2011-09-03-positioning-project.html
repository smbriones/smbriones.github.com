  This past Monday I was given the assignment of reading an article and creating a
  one-page website using the things I learned.
</p>
<p>
  The article was “<a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/37-css-absolute-and-fixed-positioning/">CSS absolute and fixed positioning</a>” on
  <a href="http://www.dev.opera.com">Dev.Opera</a> by Tommy Olsson. I carefully read t  he article, did the exercises and some sketchnoting.

  While reading and taking notes, I thought that maybe the best way to remember everything I had read and practice the things I had learned, was to create something that could be used as a reference.
</p>
<p>
  So here's <a href="http://blog.stephaniebriones.com/testing/positioning/">what I came up with</a>:

  This was a really fun assignment, (Thanks, <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/billy-whited">Billy</a>!) and I hope that the article will be as informative to you as it was to me, and that you may be able to learn a little something from my project or just use it as a reference.

<p>
  Also, shout-out to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ryanbriones/">@ryanbriones</a> for writing some jQuery for me so that the horizontal scrolling would be pretty. It added so much. Thank you.
