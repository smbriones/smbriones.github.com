<h4>Digital Tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">XScope</a>
    <p>
      I've been using XScope almost every day ever since installing it. It's probably 
      the most useful app on my computer currently. I use it for things like color, 
      alignment, measuring, etc.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://fount.artequalswork.com/">Fount</a>
    <p>
      Fount is plug-in that I use a lot. If there's a typeface that I like or want to 
      identify, in just a couple of clicks, I know what it is with Fount.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/">github:help</a>
    <p>
      Something I have used, but should visit more often is the Github Cheat Sheet.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://pxtoem.com/">PX to EM conversion</a>
    <p>
      I use this site all the time for my pixels to em, em to pixel conversion needs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/">The Shapes of CSS</a>
    <p>
      I refer to this article almost every time I need to create a CSS shape. It's a great 
      list of basic and some not-so-basic shapes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a>
    <p>
      A really cool site that will tell it like it is. Not for the easily offended. 
      It judges your CSS pretty harshly, but will definitely make you more awake of 
      the importance of well-written CSS. I need to remember to use it 
      more myself.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.text-image.com/index.html">ASCII Art Generator</a>
    <p>
      A great, simple ASCII art generator.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.patternify.com/">CSS Pattern Generator</a>
    <p>
      I came across Patternify recently and think it's a nice tool to use 
      for creating simple background patterns.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analog Tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> 
      Pencil + Paper. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to sketch out everything with plain paper and a pencil. To add a little 
      more life to my sketches I use:
    </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
    <a 
      href="http://www.prismacolor.com/products/art-markers/double-ended">Prismacolor Markers</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://artgraphic.fabercastell.com/products/product_detail.aspx?id=93AE8E0AD021495381C495ADB399EF7D">Faber-Castell PITT Artist Pens</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Hope this list helps you find a new tool to love.
