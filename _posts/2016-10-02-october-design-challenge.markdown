This month I'm taking a little time each day to focus on improving my design skills. I find that having a set schedule, with an assigned task for each day, forces me to take time to accomplish things that I'd really like to, but simply don't prioritize.

I've put together a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/enFpLVAz/october-design-challenge) with a column for each week, and a card for each day that very briefly outlines a small project, (starting with today). I've intentionally kept the requirements vague in order to leave plenty of room for creativity, and to go in whatever direction the task might take me.

Some of these projects are things I've done in the past as a [design apprentice](http://stephaniebriones.com/apprenticeship) that I thought it would be fun to [revisit](http://blog.stephaniebriones.com/testing/skills/index.html). Others are spins on challenges I've come across in design [articles](https://creativemarket.com/blog/how-to-become-a-better-designer-in-30-days-the-challenge) I've read.

My [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/enFpLVAz/october-design-challenge) is public, so please feel free to take a look at what I'll be learning or creating this month. If this is something you're interested in participating in, join me and create your own Trello board, use a calendar, a spreadsheetâ€”whichever tool you feel will keep you most accountable. You could also have some fun customizing your challenges based on areas where you'd like to improve personally. I'd love to see what you come up with.

I'll be sharing my progress on the [board](https://trello.com/b/enFpLVAz/october-design-challenge), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/smbriones), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/smbriones/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/smbriones), or here on my blog, (whatever is most appropriate for the particular challenge) in order to help keep myself accountable throughout the month.

If you do join in this month, or sometime in the future, I wish you the best of luck, and hope that you'll come away from your challenges feeling refreshed and inspired.

Cheers!
