<p>
  So, I don't know how anyone could go from TextMate to VIM and not be overwhelmed, but 
  MacVim is installed and I no longer have a caps lock key. I can deal with it, (thanks 
  <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/steve-kim">Skim</a>!) Now I just have
  to start using it.
</p>
<h3>It's complicated</h3>
<p>
  I'm not used to using a lot of commands to get around, so this is already a big change 
  for me, not to mention the whole new crazy editor thing. I can probably get past 
  the commands, but if I have to figure out how to navigate and 
  go about my normal routine on top of that, it's just too much at one time.
</p>
<h3>Keep Calm and Use Plugins</h3>
<p>
  Thankfully I'm not the only one in this boat. I've come across several 
  articles written by people that recently made the switch
  from TextMate to VIM, but the ones that actually stuck with it made
  modifications to make it easier. So that's what I'm doing.
</p>
<p>
  I have had multiple recommendations to use 
  <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> to help with the transition. 
  So now Janus is installed, (thanks 
  <a href="http://www.ryanbriones.com">Ryan</a>!) and I got to play with 
  <a href="http://www.vi-improved.org/color_sampler_pack/">
    color schemes</a>, which was fun. It's looking and feeling less and less intimidating 
  each time I open it and start editing.

<p>
  With the combination of 
  <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a>, (and 
  <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NERDTree</a>, of course) tolerable colors, and some 
  simple commands, I may actually get somewhere. I can learn a really 
  useful command here and there and ease my way into it.
