  After flipping through the book several times, keeping in mind that
  whatever I selected had to be 
  <a href="http://stephaniebriones.com/animations/index.html">animated</a> 
  based on the descriptions in the book, I decided on the following three:
</p>
<h3>1. Diffusion.</h3>
<p>
  “An irregular dispersion of objects in a composition is called 
  diffusion. The structure can gradually shift from being fine to 
  coarse, and from sparsely to highly saturated.”
</p>

<p>
  This section is made up of 200 absolutely positioned spans and 
  uses transitions to make the dots larger and smaller, (obviously 
  this isn't the most practical option, but it was the "prettier" 
  way to do it). 
</p>
<p>
  Not absolutely positioning each span resulted in 
  a choppy hovering experience. Each dot was shoving all of the 
  other dots out of the way.
</p>   
<h3>2. Negative/Positive.</h3>
<p>
  “The terms <em>negative</em> and <em>positive</em> relate to 
  opposite values such as opaque and transparent, light and dark, 
  convex and concave, solid and hollow.”

  The two discs are rotating 360&deg; showing an example of 
  the effect of negative and positive colors on negative and 
  positive backgrounds.
</p>
<h3>3. Overlapping.</h3>
<p>
  “When parts of an object lie above parts of another object, 
  the first object overlaps the second one.” The red, transparent circle 
  hovers over the black showing an example of objects overlapping.
