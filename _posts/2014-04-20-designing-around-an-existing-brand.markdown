It's difficult for product owners to come to terms with the need for a redesign.
They fear that customers will no longer recognize them and that it will cost the company
too much. Unfortunately a lot of times the original branding created doesn't age well.
It appears outdated in contrast with current design trends.

A company of course wants to keep up. They don't want to fall behind their competitors.
What choices are they left with when changing a brand can be so difficult, time consuming,
and expensive?

#### It's worth it

One of the most complex parts of rebranding, outside of cost, is that everyone needs
to be on the same page. The team will also need to come up with the necessary time
and budget. A redesign depends on tight feedback loops, and if you're doing it right,
take several iterations to complete.

Large companies do this quite often â€” maybe more than we realize. It makes them more
competitive because customers enjoy seeing something new. Whether the design pleases
everyone or not, it demonstrates a commitment to keeping the product fresh.

Start by encouraging collaboration. It may take some time to establish a good relationship,
but once you've arrived, it's the best part of the creative process.

#### A little goes a long way

You don't always need to do a complete redesign of a brand. It is definitely possible
to get away with just polishing it up. If the company logo seems dated because of
heavy gradients and drop-shadows, simply removing them can go a long way.

There are also many quality, affordable typefaces you can recommend that on their own can
modernize the brand. If thoughtfully selected, a new typeface can provide a refresh
without tampering at all with brand recognition.

A more dramatic approach would be to create something new using only the company's
color palette. If you're given this opportunity, don't take it lightly. Remember that
they are taking a big risk.

Keep in mind that your client knows their product and customers better than you do.
Part of being a professional means having empathy and making things better, not
worse. Set your ego aside.

#### When there's nothing you can do

More commonly, at least in my experience at a software consultancy, you will need to
work with the existing brand. Not every client will be able to justify the cost of
reprinting marketing materials. Making changes to all their web properties will cost
them a lot of time and money. And they could be spending most of their budget on
building the product. What then?

You do your best and be patient. If having a discussion first doesn't work out, design
around it:

* If the colors in the logo are bold, style the rest of the application with softer,
complementary colors.
* Don't use more than a few colors. This way the logo can be itself and the
rest of the layout isn't trying to compete for attention.
* Use colors from the brand in the foreground for actions (buttons, links) and keep
everything else subtle.

Try to help the client understand why you think it might be time for an update. It's
important to have good reasons prepared and suggestions for how to go about it. Saying
"I don't like it." or "It's just not good." isn't going to get you anywhere or be
helpful to anyone.

Prove that you care about the success of the product by listening more than you speak.
They will be more likely to have an open mind if they understand that you are looking
out for their best interest. They have come to you for your expertise, so give your
expert opinion, but always do so with respect.
