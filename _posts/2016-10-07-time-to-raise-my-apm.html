  Before August of this year, my favorite kind of gaming was on the Super Nintendo
  that I received from my parents on my 11th birthday. My best summer days were spent
  trying to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3">save Princess
  Toadstool</a> from the dreadful Bowser. I still turn it on
  every now and then, and it'll always be my favorite. üíñ
</p>

<p>But let's talk about <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/">Overwatch</a>.</p>

<p>
  My partner started playing Overwatch when it first came out. He'd watch the pros
  play on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Overwatch">Twitch</a>. He
  enjoyed it so much that he got serious about it and built a gaming PC. I thought,
  ‚ÄúI don't want to build a computer for one game.‚Äù But it looked really fun, so
  I decided to play on our PS4. It <em>was</em> fun.
</p>

<p>
  Then I played on Rick's PC. The graphics, the speed‚Äîit was all so good. I fell
  in love. Four weeks of PC part shopping later I had built my own gaming PC and
  starting playing with Rick and friends.

<p>
  So what has this console fan learned about PC gaming? I can't say I have a lot
  of tips to offer, or even much to say about strategy. My aim is still pretty bad,
  and I'm not sure what I'm doing much of the time, but I play because it's fun.
  Because Overwatch is a super fun game.
</p>

<h2>Why is it so fun?</h2>

<p>
  What is it about Overwatch that makes it so fun? I haven't played many other PC
  games, so this might not be new to other folks, but here is what is fun about it
  to me:
<p>

<br>
<h3>1. Teamwork</h3>
<p>
  You can't win in Overwatch if you don't play as a team, (well you might be able
  to, but it's pretty tough). You have to work together because more than likely
  the opposing team will be working together. If you try to go off on your own,
  that other team will take you out, and you'll spend the whole match
  respawning and trying to get back to the fight rather than helping your team
  move the payload or defend the point.
</p>

<h3>2. Characters</h3>
<p>
  The heroes in Overwatch are so well designed and there is a hero for everyone,
  whatever your preferred playing style.
</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Overwatch_characters.png" />
<br>
<p>
  Currently there are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Overwatch">
  22 heroes</a> to choose from, all with different abilities to master, so it
  would be pretty tough to get bored.
</p>

<h3>3. Maps</h3>
<p>
  Just like the design of everything else in Overwatch, the maps are amazing. There
  are so many places to hide, explore, and set up your defenses. They're also huge
  so it takes quite a bit of time to really know your way around them. Kudos to
  the designers and developers for making these so detailed and beautiful.

<br>

<h4>4. Microinteractions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      There's just something magically satisfying about earning a loot box and
      opening it. It sort of reminds me of the mushroom houses and getting 1ups in
      Super Mario Brothers. They don't come around so often that you stop appreciating
      them.
    </p>
  </li>

  <br>
  <li>
    <p>
      Emotes. Each hero has a simple default emote like moving into a different
      position with their weapon, but you can earn new ones with loot boxes, or use
      the currency you earn in the game to buy other fun ones, and they're all unique
      to the heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      D.Va has this fun one of her playing a game in her mech that I love:
    </p>

    polygon</a></span>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Then you have Sprays, like graffiti, and you earn or ‚Äúbuy‚Äù really neat ones to
      tag walls, floors, or whatever. It's just another fun way of interacting with your
      teammates as these different characters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can also earn or buy voice lines that make your character say different
      things in the game. Before matches the heroes will also start talking to one
      another automatically which I find super cute.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  Now that I'm getting better at the mechanics of gaming with a mouse and keyboard,
  I feel like I can start improving my aim and <em>maybe</em> even be a little more
  strategic. Anyway, I'm really having fun, and I'd recommend giving Overwatch a
  try if you haven't already. :)
