Back in March I started an [online course](http://journalismcourses.org/D3.html) on d3.js
and data visualization. It was taught by Alberto Cairo and Scott Murray through The Knight
Center for Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin.

I really enjoyed taking this course. I feel like I was able to learn how to do some things
that I might have been too intimidated to try on my own.

I'll continue learning d3.js and data visualization, and I am particularly interested
in learning how to do more advanced styling with SVG and learn more about working with
different types of data.

I kept all of my exercises here throughout the course:
