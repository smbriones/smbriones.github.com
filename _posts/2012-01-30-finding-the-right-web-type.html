<p>
  An obvious consideration is style. You have to know what look you're going for. 
  The best way to know that is to really think about your project. Who is your audience? 
  What is your content? Do you have a ton of paragraphs of text or just a few lines and 
  some images? Try to figure that out before you begin looking.
</p>

<p>
  Knowing what you're looking for before you start will go a long way in helping you select 
  something that is right for your project. 
</p>
<p>
  You'll know whether you need a highly readable serif or sans-serif typeface for your body 
  text or if you can use something more playful or strong with your few lines of text. Make 
  a list of characteristics, use simple words, and make them your shopping list. 
</p>
<h3>Your Search</h3>
<p>
  It's easy to get sidetracked and find typefaces that you really like, but aren't right 
  for the project. As difficult as it may be, avoid the temptation to use them anyway and 
  just make a note of them for later. There's always next time.
</p>
<p>
  After you have found and made a short list of possibilities, compare them side by side. 
  Test them out using real content. You'll get a better sense of the true character of the 
  typefaces that you've selected.
</p>
<p>
  When making your final decision, you'll want to check to see how versatile the typeface 
  will be. How many weights and styles it has. The more, the better. You'll at least want to 
  make sure it has a normal weight, true italics, and a bold. Hopefully you'll be able to 
  find one with additional lighter weights, heavier weights and small caps to choose from.
</p>
<p>
  If supporting multiple languages is important, take a look at the font's character set, 
  or see if it tells you in the description which or how many languages it supports.

<h3>When cost matters</h3>
<p>
  If you're on a budget, there are some free or low cost services available that could 
  work for you, but whatever you do, don't settle for typefaces that don't match your 
  requirements.
</p>
<p>
  If you're new to selecting typefaces and aren't sure you'll be able to notice the 
  differences in a well made and not-so-well made typeface, you can always start out by 
  looking at very high quality, expensive typefaces first.
</p> 
<p>
  Take a look at what is offered by some of the well-known foundries, look at them carefully, 
  try them out with your content, take screen shots. When you know what you like, try out 
  some lower cost options and compare them.
</p>
<p>
  You may notice the differences in quality and you'll be able to search for a typeface 
  that more closely matches your shopping list. Something more affordable, but made well 
  enough that you will be happy with it. Just don't settle. 
</p>
<p>
  In the end, you might even decide that the best thing you can do for your website, product, project, 
  whatever it is that you're working on, is to splurge on a typeface or two that will 
  give you the professional, thought-out, clean and polished look that it deserves.

  or to individual quality typefaces.
