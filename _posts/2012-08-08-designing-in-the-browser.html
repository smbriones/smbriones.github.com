  I'd like to tell you a little about one of my favorite tools; my browser's web
  inspector. I'm often asked what I like to use for wireframing or mockups and if
  I use PhotoShop or something else. The answer usually ends up being “It depends”.
</p>
<p>
  Of course there are times for sketches, simple wireframes, (I like
<a href="http://www.hotgloo.com/">HotGloo</a>), and even PhotoShop, but lately
  I have been using the web inspector as a quick prototyping tool.
</p>
<p>
  I'll edit html, add css, and apply the desired changes to my files. In many
  situations, it's a perfect tool to demonstrate an idea and get quick feedback.
  It's more detailed than a sketch, but only takes a minute or two to make several
  changes.
</p>
<p>
  While using the web inspector, I accomplish a few things at once:
</p>
<h3>Learning about the codebase</h3>
<p>
  Using the web inspector to explore provides an opportunity to get to know
  unfamiliar applications. While clicking around I'm identifying class names and
  IDs, I'm taking a look at the way that the html is structured, and where styles
  are kept.

<p>
  A lot of times, unless it's your CSS, it's going to take a bit of time to
  understand it; to figure out how coupled things are. When not written well,
  CSS is a tangled mess that acts like an unfortunate game of Jenga. You pull
  out the wrong block and the whole thing topples over.
</p>
<p>
  Playing around in the browser's inspector tool provides you with a nice sneak
  peak of the structure and styling fun you're getting into. Dealing with multiple
  stylesheets becomes much easier.
</p>
<p>
  As a bonus, the web inspector also makes it easier to help others when they're
  stuck. I'm able to better explain what's happening behind the scenes with margins
  and padding or block and in-line elements.
</p>
<p>
  Examining blocks of color representing margins, padding and elements themselves
  is, in my experience, the fastest way to fix layout issues.
</p>
<h3>Creating a quick prototype</h3>
<p>
  Doing a little bit of work in the browser allows me to explain what I'd like to
  accomplish to others on the project. That, in turn, helps me solidify what I want
  to do and figure out the best way to make it happen. A lot of times I'll make
  changes in the browser and take a screen shot of something I'd like to do,
  then share it with my team and quickly get their feedback.

<p>
  Editing css and html in the browser has always helped me solve tricky problems.
  Without it I don't believe I would understand as much as I do about how the box
  model works, or why certain elements need "display: inline-block;" or
  "overflow: hidden;" to behave the way you want them to.
</p>
<p>
  A lot of times, as I'm writing html and css, I can visualize the results in the
  browser before refreshing the page. I owe that to the things I've learned using
  the web inspector.
</p>
<h3>Some tips on using the Web Inspector</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Use Chrome's "Developer Tools". This obviously isn't a requirement, and it's
    mostly personal preference, but for what it's worth, Chrome's web inspector has
    been the most helpful and it's features most pleasant to use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try to get out of the habit of refreshing the page too soon. One of the issues
    with counting on the web inspector is that you'll lose your experimental changes
    if you refresh, but are some things you can do to help prevent that.

    If you have two tabs open at a time; one for your web inspector changes and
    one for actual changes, it will make things easier. You can also copy your
    changes over to your editor regularly if you'd prefer having fewer things to
    look at. I like to take screen shots of my changes to share and reference later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Playing with font sizes and element widths is so simple. Just click on the
    current size (e.g. 24px, 1.777em, 50%) and when it becomes an input, just
    use your up and down arrow keys to increase and decrease font sizes, widths,
    heights, whatever you'd like. Additionally, hovering over an element using
    the magnifying glass while adjusting the size, gives you an even better idea
    of what you're doing.

  </li>
  <li>
    Editing html. I know, kind of crazy sounding, but this is one of my new
    favorite things to do. For example, if you have an image from another area
    of the site that you want to try out on the page, you can copy the code for
    that image, right click, select "Edit as HTML" and paste it where you would
    like it to go. This quickly gives you an idea of how it will look.
  </li>
  <li>
    One last cool thing is the location info that you get through the web inspector.
    When you inspect an element, you also get a little bit of information on which
    stylesheet the styles are coming from and which line in the file you can find
    them on.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Designing in the browser, for the browser</h3>
<p>
  I use the web inspector daily. It's been my go-to tool ever since I started
  learning to create things for the web. It's been only in the last 6 months to
  a year that I've started to realize all of its other uses.
</p>
<p>
  So I write with the hope that if you're not using the web inspector for development
  now, that you give it a try. You'll probably wonder why you hadn't been using
  it all along.
