title: "Speed-O-Meter: An assignment in CSS transitions and jQuery"
snippet: "Before the holidays, I was given the mission to create a working speedometer using HTML, CSS, and jQuery."

<p>
The inspiration for my <a href="http://stephaniebriones.com/speedometer/">Speed-O-Meter</a> assignment 
was drawn from <a href="http://annyas.com/chevrolet-speedometer-design">this</a> 
collection of Chevrolet speedometers from between 1941 and 2011. It's 
amazing how something as simple as a speedometer on a dashboard, when shown in a different light, 
can be so interesting.

The simple black and white without all the frills allows one to focus on 
the typography and creativity of the placement. With the older ones, it looks as if a lot of thought 
and care went into the selection of the typefaces and the layout. The 
needles were much more interesting. Here are some good examples:

<a href="/images/blog/speedometer/red-needle.png">2</a>
<a href="/images/blog/speedometer/1949-Nash.png">3</a>
</p>
<p>
First order: figure out how to manipulate a <em>div</em> with the jQuery UI slider. Getting a slider on the 
page was simple enough, but the part that I didn't know how to do was 
connect it to the <em>div</em> so that 
when it was toggled, the <em>div</em> rotated using CSS transitions.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/billy-whited">Billy</a>, that was working pretty 
quickly. I was able to start resizing the <em>div</em> (needle) and some adding numbers to the page for it to point to.
</p>
<p>
My next step was to find the right typeface. I really like the speedometers from the 40's and 50's the 
most. Most of them seem to use a squarish, bold, geometric typeface. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/kimberley/">Kimberley Regular</a> seems a good choice for 
that. It has a vintage feel and the characteristics that I was looking for. I used Illustrator to rotate 
the numbers clock-wise. (I positioned them all with CSS first, but the transforms skewed the numbers in 
a way that was inconsistent, so an image it is.)
</p>

<p>
For a bit of a fun touch, I wanted to pair Kimberley with a scripty mid-century looking font. 
<a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontdiner/air-conditioner/">Air Conditioner</a> seems to fit that 
criteria pretty well.
</p>

<p>
Next, we wanted to have the dots, (below each number) turn red as the needle passed by. Doing 
that in jQuery is quite beyond my abilities, so with a crescent-shaped image with holes cut out where 
the dots should be, I was halfway there. 
</p>
<p>
The other part making it work is an HTML element attached to the needle div. That crescent-shaped 
image that is the same color as the background of the page, has a really high z-index, putting it above 
the needle and the attached HTML element that forms the little red circle.
</p>

    When the needle makes it's way around, the only time you see the red dot is when the needle points 
    directly at a number on the speedometer.

<p>
Another idea that we wanted to implement was the possibility of having the spacebar control acceleration 
as well as the arrows and mouse clicks. For this I searched all over. 
</p>
<p>
I was pretty sure I needed to use <em>keypress</em>, or <em>keyup</em> and <em>keydown</em>, 
but could not figure out how to get more than an alert to pop up when the spacebar was pressed. I knew what 
I needed, but just didn't know how to move forward. 
</p>
<p>
I went to Myles, a fellow resident apprentice at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a>, and he 
was able to help me get the spacebar to control the acceleration. Playing with it more, I really wanted it 
to decelerate on <em>keyup</em>. Billy worked with me again and we were able to get it to decelerate as 
well, however, not very gracefully. It would just jump back down to -90° instantly, not slowly, like the 
needle.
</p>
<p>
Myles came up with a new variable called <em>isAccelerating</em> which is set to <em>false</em>, 
applied that to the <em>keydown</em> and <em>keyup</em> events. <em>keydown</em> was set to 
<em>isAccelerating = true;</em> and <em>keydown</em>, <em>false</em>. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore the speedometer is always decelerating unless the spacebar is pressed down. When the spacebar 
is pressed, the deceleration is interrupted. Then he added <em>setInterval (decelerate, 100);</em> to ease the 
deceleration and let the slider handle fall gracefully back to it's -90° position. We applied everything 
to the right arrow as well so they would both act the same way. 
</p>
<p>
I'm really glad that I'm surrounded by smart people that can help me with this kind of thing. I definitely 
feel like I have learned a lot by doing this exercise and that wouldn't have been possible without the 
guidance of some really smart guys. I look forward to learning a lot more.
