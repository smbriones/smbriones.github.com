snippet: "Usability testing is a very valuble part of great user experience, yet it seems to be 
ignored a lot of times. I think a lot of people get the impression that it's too expensive and 
just takes too much time to do."

<p>
  There are ways to do user testing that cost very little and take no more than a couple hours of time. 
  The things that can be learned from some simple user testing, however, are priceless.
</p>
<p>
  In <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6658783-rocket-surgery-made-easy">
  Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a>, Steve Krug explains how you can conduct simple and 
  effective user tests on your own. Until I actually tried it out for myself, I wasn't aware 
  of how fascinating user testing would be.
</p>
<p>
  To see someone use a site that I created and feel the pain of my poor decisions, or point out 
  good ones, was surprisingly mind-altering and a very enjoyable experience. Just seeing the way 
  that other people use a browser, in itself, was intriguing.
</p>
<p>
  I installed <a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a> to record the session, prepared a 
  script, asked some questions, and had the testers do a few things on my blog. Even though I have 
  plans for changes to my blog, it seemed like a good time to test and figure out the things that 
  should change for the user versus things I just wanted to change for me.
</p>
<p>
  It was interesting that they each pointed out some of the very same things, but also unique 
  things. Things that I had already thought about and some that I hadn't. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Some of the things that the testers struggled with were:</strong>
</p>  
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
    <strong>Navigation</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    My blog has almost no navigation. There is a link at the top of the page, my name, which takes 
    you to the home page and each individual blog post on the home page takes you to the post, to go 
    back, you need to know to click on my name again to return to the home page and back to the list 
    of blog posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Probably some breadcrumbs. I haven't decided yet. Other things that 
    would help may include a "back to top" link at the bottom of long posts to make it easier to 
    return to the top.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <strong>Tweeting a post</strong>
  </p>  
  <p>
    Currently you can tweet a blog post from the bottom of the blog post. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Moving that to the top, where it would be natural to return when you're 
    finished reading, would make it a lot easier to find and use.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    <strong>No dates on posts</strong>
  </p>  
  <p>
    This actually bothers me a lot too, and it'd probably be simple to change with a little help. 
    Right now you can see all of the posts on the page, but there's no obvious order to anything, 
    it's just a long list.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Find a developer that can help me add dates to my blog posts.
  </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>What was good:</strong>
</p>
  <p>
    One thing that they all agreed on was the fact that it was clean and simple. Something that I 
    should keep in mind when working on changing things up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope to never forget how much I got out of that short session of user testing and the value 
    it brought to even a small two page website like my blog. The best thing about user testing is that 
    it can never be done too late. It can be done at any time and by anyone.
