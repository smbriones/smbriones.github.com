The past year was interesting for me for many reasons. I’ll share some of
those shortly. First, I wanted to reflect on my post from this time last lear;
<a href="http://blog.stephaniebriones.com/2015/01/08/new-year-new-habits.html"
target="_blank">New Year, New Habits</a>.

In January of last year, there were some simple life improvements
that I wanted to make. Instead of being intimidated by goals, I wanted to
embrace the power of forming good habits. I started with making the bed before
leaving the bedroom every day, and drinking a lot more water.

I’m happy to report that I did make a habit of making the bed every day. I can’t
count more than a couple of times that it was left unmade throughout the entire
year. I can’t say the same for the drinking water habit, but the amount of water
I drank this year did improve a lot thanks to <a href="http://45.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbg84cvrTO1qzjykfo1_400.gif" target="_blank">LaCroix</a>.
