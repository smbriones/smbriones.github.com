<p>
  This past week I was able to start using 
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> 
  for blog posts and got to play with <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> a little bit.
</p>

<p>
  Using Jekyll with github pages is very cool and I can't wait to really get the hang of it. I'm 
  currently using it for my blog, and I just started using it for the 8th Light blog posts being 
  migrated to the new website.
</p>

<p>
  Haml is interesting. I prefer plain old HTML, however I'm really glad I've had the opportunity 
  to try it out and learn some of the syntax.
</p>

<h3>Reading Materials</h3>

<p>
  I've been reading a little more this week. I just finished 
  <a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/">Thinking with Type</a>. 
  A really great book that I will probably use as a reference for quite a long time. There are so many 
  things to know about type and <a href="http://elupton.com/">Ellen Lupton's</a> book was a lovely, 
  well written, burst of information.
</p>

<p>
  I also started reading 
  <a href="http://www.simpleandusable.com/">Simple and Usable: web, mobile, and interaction design</a>
  Thursday Night. Since I've been trying to come up with layout ideas and researching typefaces for an app 
  I'm helping with, starting this book next was a good choice.</p>

<h3>Learning the process</h3>

<p>
  Sketching has been one of the most helpful steps in the design process for me. I can get feedback 
  from a simple sketch before attempting to go further. Billy taught me to take a look at what I'm 
  designing, understand what it does, make a map of it, then stop looking at the screen for a while 
  and sketch.
</p>

<p>
  I tend to get a little too excited and sometimes skip to the type, colors, and layout. Learning to 
  take it slow, consider the audience, and practice usability is a goal of mine.
</p>

<h3>Tech Week and Startup Weekend</h3>

<p>
  Saturday I spent part of the day at Tech Week which is taking place at Merchandise Mart. I 
  <a href="http://instagr.am/p/IWfFb/">listened to Billy's talk</a> 
  titled "On web Typography: Choosing and using fonts on screen" and took some sketchnotes and 
  photos, which I may post later this week.

  <p>I really enjoyed his talk and the audience seemed to get a lot out of it also.</p>

<p>
  Afterward, I went over to Tech Nexus with <a href="http://ryanbriones.com/">Ryan</a>, (My husband and 
  <a href="http://obtiva.com/">Obtivian</a>) to check up on the teams doing 
  <a href="http://chicago.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a>. He had been there Friday night and spent 
  all weekend there mentoring teams and offering feedback on their ideas and what they were trying to 
  accomplish.
</p>

</p>  
<p>
  It was a really great experience seeing the teams work so passionately toward their goals. Listening 
  to them practice their pitches and realizing how much work they had done in just over 2 days was 
  inspiring.
</p>

<p>
  Sunday afternoon I went with all of the teams, 11 in total, over to Merchandise Mart where they gave 
  their pitches to the judges.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.picture.ly/?q=%23techweek">#techweek picture.ly stream</a>
</p>  
<p>Three teams were selected to move on to <a href="http://www.sparkchi.com/">S.P.A.R.K.</a> and they will 
  be working extremely hard for the next 3 days with three software development companies in Chicago and one 
  will win. (Good luck!)
</p>
