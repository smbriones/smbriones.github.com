  We worked with the non-profit organization , 
  <a href="http://www.kidshavehope.org">Kids Have Hope</a> and redesigned their entire website 
  from scratch within 24 hours.

  They can now update both their twitter and facebook accounts at one time from their app 
  making it easy to publicize thier donation campaigns. They also have a mailing list now, 
  an events calendar, paypal integration for event tickets, and dynamic quizes for kids to take.

  I was super lucky to be on a team that did stand-up every few hours and kept on track 
  with estimations. Reminded me, as if I needed reminding, of how great it is to be able to be 
  apprenticing at 8th Light.

  It was a very long 24 hours, we didn't sleep, and it was completely worth it.
