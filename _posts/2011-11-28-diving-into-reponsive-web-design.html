snippet: "I come across brilliantly designed websites all of the time. My favorite by far are the ones that are beautiful, 
but when the window is resized, they become extraordinary."

Truly responsive websites are perfect on all browser window sizes and collapse and flow as you resize. 
They look beautiful on mobile devices and tablets, as if they were made specifically for that device. 
I love to see columns and menus rearrange in a gorgeous, functional way.

The idea of being able to do this myself has always been sort of a far away, "maybe one day" type thing 
in my mind, but it turns out that it doesn't have to be. There are so many tools out there now, but the 
one that I've used, and loved is 
<a href="http://www.designbyfront.com/demo/goldilocks-approach/">The Goldilocks Approach</a> 
from <a href="http://designbyfront.com/">Front</a>.

<p>
There's also <a href=" http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a> 
by Ethan Marcotte, which will explain how to make your design responsive. The list of great resources 
on Responsive Web Design is ever growing.

It seems silly to me now to put off making my web designs responsive, especially given how amazing the 
results will be in the end.

<p>
I recently converted my blog to a responsive layout using The Goldilocks Approach and was very surprised 
at how quickly I was able to get it working. It helps that it's a really simple website, but it was a nice experience. 
</p>
<p>
I'm currently working on a web app design that will also be responsive without any boilerplate stuff. It's 
a bit more complex than a blog site, so it's a great learning experience.
