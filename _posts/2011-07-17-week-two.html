	I'm learning first hand that utilizing the combination of these three things
	when developing your layout can make all the difference.
</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>
	This past week, as I've been working on a new blog layout, I have had the chance to learn a lot
	about different typefaces. I didn't realize there were so many things to consider when selecting a
	typeface and how important it is to also understand when you should use different
	<a href="http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/text/hierarchy.htm">sizes, weights and
		styles</a>.
</p>
<p>
	For my new blog layout, I'm using Ronnia for everything, except for my name. It may not always work out
	to choose one typeface for everything, a lot of times it doesn't, but in Ronnia's case it
	actually works pretty nicely for both display and body text.

<h3>Grids</h3>
<p>
	I'm learning to use grids and this past week I began using one for my blog layout. It was quite the challenge.
	I'm pretty sure I have quite a bit more practicing to do before I know how to set one up on my own.

	Luckily
	<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/billy-whited">Billy</a> and
	<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/colin-jones">Colin</a> are working on creating a new, simple grid
	generator. I personally cannot wait. Anything to make using a grid easier has my vote.

<h3>Modular Scale</h3>
<p>
	Using a Modular Scale makes choosing sizes for your text much easier. You start with your body type size.
	Once you have that you can easily select the larger sizes and smaller sizes for everything else. I think
	this is one of the coolest things I've learned. It's so useful.

<h3>Other fun things</h3>
<p>
	I finished the first step in the blog post migration process, so this coming week I will most likely get to
	see the next step. We're using Jekyll and github pages for our blog posts now, so that will be exciting to see.
</p>
<p>
	On Friday I had a lot of fun working with
	<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/eric-meyer">Eric</a> on an iPhone app for the first time ever. I do need
	to learn more about designing mobile apps, but it was a blast and I can't wait to work on it again, see it finished,
	and post more about it here.
